                    Mazda's menu are well-organized and easy to sift through. It's sophiscated and clean.
                    Their website has a good use of white-space. The spacing around all the objects allows
                    viewers to easily find what they are looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clean design focuses on the careful and precise position of the important elements throughout the
                    website. Mazda's website illustrates clean design very well.

                <p>
                    The photo successfully uses the rule of thirds because it creates a feel of natural balance and
                    perfect symmetry. The objects in the photo (the rock, the girl, and clothing) and the placement of
                    the objects creates a feel and movement to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rule of thirds is used in web design to create balance within the images or other elements of
                    the landing page. Zara's website followed the rule of thirds and well organized it through their
                    design.

                <p>
                    The bold rainbow of colors of the apple phones and black background of the apple watch are a huge
                    contrast. Both objects and color choice are a powerful glow emanating from the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrast is the relationship between two or more design elements whose dramatic differences are
                    emphasized when both elements are shown together. Apple's web design does a great job with contrast
                    and bring both elements together.
