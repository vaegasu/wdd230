        <h1>History of Bountiful Foods</h1>
        <p>It's become something of a tradition. As autumn peaks across the United States, urban Americans head to the
            countryside to pick through craggy branches for crimson apples or zigzag through corn mazes on frosty
            mornings.</p><br>

        <p>These short road trips to farms for Instagrammable fun have become more popular in the past 20 years, feeding
            an agritourism industry that's grown from pennies to billions of dollars.</p><br>

        <p>Yet snapshots of overflowing apple crates or toddlers clambering on toy tractors don't capture the complex
            history of pick-your-own farms. That history stretches from the depths of the Great Depression and
            illustrates how farmers harvested fortune from hardship.</p><br>

        <picture><img src="images/about-us.jpeg" alt="tradition" class="center"></picture><br>

        <p>Farmers tilled acres of new soil to meet the unprecedented needs of World War I. They kept producing at
            elevated levels after the conflict ended, which was amplified by the shift from horses to engines. Advances
            in livestock and plant sciences further boosted surpluses at the exact wrong time.</p><br>
